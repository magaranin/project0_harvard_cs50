By Margarita Sirbu

Description: 
The website has three pages: one for Google Search, one for Google Image Search, and one for Google Advanced Search. 

Details:
The top section of each page consists of navigation elements that link the 3 pages together.
On the Google Search page, the user is able to type in a query, click “Google Search”, and is taken to the Google search results to the corresponding Google Search results page. 
The “I’m Feeling Lucky” button is consistent to the main Google Search page is consistent with Google’s own behavior. Clicking this button takes the user directly to the location of the first Google search result for the query, bypassing the normal results page.
On the Google Image Search page, the user is able to type in a query. Clicking the search button here will take the user to the Google Image search results for that query.
On the Google Advanced Search page, the user is able to provide input for the following four fields.
    1. Find pages with… “all these words:”
    2. Find pages with… “this exact word or phrase:”
    3. Find pages with… “any of these words:”
    4. Find pages with… “none of these words:”
Clicking the search button here will take the user to the Google advanced search results page.
